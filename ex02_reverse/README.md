# Reverse an array

Construct a function which will reverse an array integers.

Given the array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
`reverse(array)` must output an array where the order of elements is [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Try the following:
* Create a function which will return a new array with the elements in reverse order
* Instead of returning a new array, reverse the array in-place
* Try reversing the array as a slice type
